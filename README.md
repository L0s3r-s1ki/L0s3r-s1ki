                    _   ABOUT ME!!!!!! _
Hi! You can call me Doc (when im in medkit skin or in gen cuz i have no name basically)
UHM! I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START BUT OTHER NAMES I HAVE
Sock / Degrader / Marty / Zz / Twinkie
 im starting off nice heh.

 In ponytown I like to sit around n stuff like that, never be afraid to sit by me and cuddle! 
 It makes my day knowing that someone would like to sit by me ^^

I dont mind making new friends just get to know me and talk first just incase we are a good match... dont friend me randomly.
Im pretty chill and swag when you get to know me im just so awesome (my goodness this feels like a presentation) 
Dont bug me about "CAN I BE UR FRIEND CAN I BE UR FRIEND" Simply interact with me and see if we are on the same level if you like me or not and that goes the same way with me.
I love when people int with me on their own it makes my day... but the ones who are uhm... weird we arent gonna go there. I like WEIRD jokes but NOT THAT INAPPROPRIATE NOT TOO DIRTY. 
(heh but i can handle some spice) But ill have u know it cant be too inflicted towards me it can be inflicted towards my character but NOT irl me. 

I absolutely do not give a shit about my pronouns but theres one thing that bugs me a lot and it is when I make a mistake gendering people - if i messed up on ur gender im sorry but theres no reason to get batshit crazy and mad about it.

MY pronouns are just anything Woman or male ( She/ Her He/ Him) Normally i dont care if u say He/him towards my male characters or She/ Her towards my girl characters its ok! But i am a woman. 

I WILL GLADLY GIVE U MY SOCIAL IF WE BECOME GREAT FRIENDS AND IF I LOVE U AND MISS U >_< !!!!!

But people in gen ... dont ask for my snap excepting your gonna get it right away i need to know you. Same with my tiktok and roblox. I do NOT have discord anymore and im not planning on redownloading it any sooner or later because you asked me to. We can message through tiktok, im sorry @_@

I like people who are gentle or funny, and people with a mix of both. I love the caring ones and stuff like that >_<

When im uncomfortable I tend to say apple or I say apple when i dont know what to say else.

I really look into your personality than a book by its cover!! But a mix of both do matter in some cases like a inappropriate skin ... no. But if its a joke skin Ill take it lol.

                 __ PONY TOWN EXPECTIONS ^_^ _


 In pony town you may Int, sit with me.

W2I ! = You may always whisper to me! Or if you want permission to cuddle you can ask!! <3 <3 If you want to be my friend - DONT JUST SAY "CAN I BE YOUR FRIEND" you can meet me but please dont be weird at first, ill get comfortable with you i promise and if we are on the same level then we are gonna be bffs boom. SOMETIMES IM PLAYING A GAME OR OFFTAB SO I WONT GET TO YOU RIGHT AWAY!! ^_^ But my responses is effective immediantly and ill text you ASAP!

Busy = Im probably being lazy and sitting around doing nothing, you can Int if you want

Away = Im offtab, Busy or doing something irl, Drawing or on my phone, If your shy to talk to me and not expect a text right away, text me when i'm busy half of the time! I might be sitting around lazying too!!

Online (rarely use) = I dont use this icon cuz its ugly af... But if i use it one day SHIT IS GOING DOWN. 

If you want to vent dont vent to me, when we are friends dont immediantly vent get to know me first, and just say "hey can I talk to you?" thats a calm way. Or maybe if your a stranger and you need to get cool you can talk to me first but dont immediantly get straight to it like "My mommy beats me up every night and my daddy shits on the bed-" shit like that no. IT BE REAL FUNNY IF SOMEONE SAID THAT THOUGH LMAO 

I match peoples vibe stuff like that yeah....

idk what else i missed but be nice etc uhm so go Apeshit. (EXCITEDLY NOT ANGRY LMAOO)
